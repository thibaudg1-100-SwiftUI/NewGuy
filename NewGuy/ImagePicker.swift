                    // We need the typecast for UIImage – that’s because the data we’re provided could in theory be anything. Yes, I know we specifically asked for photos, but PHPickerViewControllerDelegate calls this same method for any kind of media, which is why we need to be careful.

    // Even though the Coordinator class is inside a UIViewControllerRepresentable struct, SwiftUI won’t automatically use it for the view’s coordinator. Instead, we need to add a new method called makeCoordinator(), which SwiftUI will automatically call if we implement it:
    func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
        Coordinator(self) // return an instance of our class Coordinator
    }
    
    // makeUIViewController(), which is responsible for creating the initial view controller:
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> PHPickerViewController {
        var config = PHPickerConfiguration()
        config.filter = .images // show only the images from the device's library
        
        
        
        let picker = PHPickerViewController(configuration: config)
        // to tell the PHPickerViewController that when something happens in the UIKit View Controller, it should tell our coordinator:
        picker.delegate = context.coordinator // our SwiftUI coordinator will act as a UIKit delegate that responds to events
        return picker
    }
    
    // updateUIViewController(), which is designed to let us update the view controller when some SwiftUI state changes:
    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: PHPickerViewController, context: Context) {
        // We aren’t going to be using updateUIViewController(), so you can just delete the “code” line from there so that the method is empty.
    }
    
    // first type the line below and Xcode will bring up a useful error that enable to inject the 2 func signature easily
    // you can remove the line after:
    //typealias UIViewControllerType = PHPickerViewController
}
